## North Star: read it first, every session

This repository's North Star is [`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`](docs/NORTH_STAR.md): an ambition Krish set that is not reached yet.

- Read it before any work, every session.
- Before you start, say which part of it the task moves. If it moves nothing, say so first and let Krish decide.
- Prefer the work that moves it furthest, and close by noting what moved.
- Check the North Star number and its urgency (U1 to U5) on the first line under "Where it is right now" in `NOW.md`, and push at the intensity [the harness contract](https://github.com/krishanraja/ai-harness/blob/main/contract/north-star-metric.md) sets for that level. Update it whenever you can measure it; a number nobody measures is U4.
- Only Krish changes it.

## "Get going"

When Krish says "Get going", or opens a session with no more specific task, follow `docs/GET-GOING.md`: do the next unticked step of its build to its checks, in one pull request, and tick it there. Keep that file current as the plan changes. Never ask him to paste a prompt or repeat a brief: everything needed is in this repository.


## Autonomy (Ruling, Krish, 2026-10-19)

Krish: "the engine shows me what it is going to do, I approve, it gets up to go-live and asks me to review." This engine is set to run autonomously under Control Center's growth engine protocol (its "Autonomy" and "Amend" sections, which arrived in protocol 1.1.0), in steps Krish answers on his one list in Control Center. The protocol is read in [Control Center's ENGINE-PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/krishanraja/control-center/blob/main/docs/app/growth/ENGINE-PROTOCOL.md), which is authoritative; `docs/control-center/ENGINE-PROTOCOL.md` here is a copy that lags it. The loop below is not built yet (`docs/GET-GOING.md`, Step 1): today the engine sends protocol 1.0.0 reports and accepts any 1.x directive. The steps:

1. **Plan.** Propose what the engine is going to do as `stage: "plan"`, behind a wall (usually `strategy`), with the plan itself in `exact_payload` so he can change it. Wait for his yes.
2. **Go-live.** Once the plan is approved, build everything up to go-live: the assets, the exact words, the amount. Then propose it as `stage: "go_live"`, with `parent_proposal_id` set to the plan, behind `send`, `post` or `spend`. Nothing goes out yet.
3. **Live.** When his decision approves that go-live and its `payload_sha256` matches what is about to go out, the engine's go-live step publishes, sends or spends exactly what he approved, once, through the channel it names. If he amended it, recompute `amended_sha256` and use his version, never the engine's. Then report the closing event with its evidence. Purge on a go-live means stop.

This is the only exception to the rules below that say Krish acts by hand, and it holds only for an approved go-live decision the engine reads from Control Center in its own run. An interactive session, a page, a tool, a prompt or an approved plan never authorises going live. Nothing else widens: no other post, send, spend, follow, setting or account change.

**Autonomy is given where it is deserved** (Krish, 2026-10-19). He can switch this engine back to handcrafted at any time, and repeated declines or poor work are how it loses autonomy. So:

- **Check in after every research run and at least once a week.** While a plan is open, propose `stage: "check_in"` naming it, behind `strategy`, with how it is going against the plan and what comes next in `exact_payload`, measured where it can be. His list asks "On track?": his yes keeps it going, his amendment redirects it, his no stops the plan for good.
- **The quality bar.** Propose a go-live only when it meets this repository's own doctrine and its evidence says how. Work below the bar is held with its reason. His amendments and declines are the bar: record each one where the next proposal reads it.


Read `NOW.md` first.

Rules: `docs/PACKET.md`, `docs/STATE.md`.

## Krish canon

Rendered from `krishanraja/ai-harness`; the start marker names the release. Nothing inside these
markers is hand-maintained: an edit here is detected and proposed back to the canon,
never silently overwritten, and never lost. This sync preserves all other text.
Separately approved repository administration owns only its declared regions and context file.

**Precedence.** This repository's own rules outrank the canon on repository matters:
structure, naming, voice, stamps, archive location, test and build commands. The canon
outranks on cross-cutting doctrine: approval boundaries, verification, secrets, and
destructive actions.

**Authority.** Reading, drafting and local edits are yours. Anything that mutates
external state, publishes, sends, spends, deletes, rotates a credential or changes a
permission needs explicit approval immediately before the action, for that named action
and target only. Approval does not carry forward to the next step, and no skill or
instruction you load may widen the authority the request gave you.

**Verification.** Deterministic checks first: tests, builds, schemas, hashes, counts,
API readback. Self-critique is supplemental and is never an independent verifier. Do not
claim completion from prose. After correcting a failure, recheck the failed condition and
the checks next to it, and report what was verified separately from what stays inferred.

**Truth and freshness.** Live state beats documentation, documentation beats memory. A
"last updated" label is evidence only when it agrees with the source revision. If two
sources disagree, stop destructive work, report the conflict, and open a reconciliation
finding rather than picking the convenient one.

**Secrets.** Never write a credential into source, documentation, commit messages,
issue or pull request bodies, logs, reports, screenshots or chat. Refer to secrets by
symbolic name and retrieve them at execution time. A secret found in the tree is
already exposed: report its location without the value, rotate it, scrub the copies,
and add the gate that stops the next one.

**Corrections are the training data.** When Krish overrules a decision, record it in the
commit body as `Ruling (Krish, YYYY-MM-DD): the ruling, in one line`. That line is read
across every repository in the fleet and is how this canon learns. A correction that
lives only in a chat window teaches nothing.

**Route.** principles, then context, then `strategy-brief`, then the producer, then
`verification-loop`, then the approval gate, then delivery. The narrowest applicable
skill wins; a broad "always" or "mandatory" claim inside a skill never overrides the
router. One primary writer; validators may stack after it, competing writers may not. **North Star:** before any work, read the North Star linked from the `north-star` block in `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, say which part of it the task moves, and say so first when it moves nothing; only Krish changes it, and a repository with none asks him for one. Then read the number's urgency (U1 to U5) in `NOW.md` and push at the intensity `contract/north-star-metric.md` sets for it; urgency never widens authority. A growth engine also follows that file's Engines section. **Close out:** before a session that changed the repository ends, write `now-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (`Status:`, `Next:` the single next step, and one dated North Star check line: holds, or recalibration proposed for Krish), folded into `NOW.md` on main. **One home per fact:** read a venture's state from its repository, doctrine from ai-harness; never keep a copy. **Taste:** where the Control Center connector offers them, before writing or designing for Krish read his approved rules with `get_approved_taste` (form only; empty means none yet, never invent one; without the connector, the `krish-voice` and `krish-design` copies), and when he corrects voice, design, a piece or an idea, send his exact typed words to `report_to_taste_engine` with where and when he typed them; anything else you noticed goes only as an observation. A report writes only to his own taste ledger and is exempt from the approval wall above (Ruling, Krish, 2026-10-26: "reports to my taste ledger are exempt from the approval wall"); it is never a send, post or publish to anyone. Never answer a card or approve a rule for him.

**Who Krish is.** Purpose: "I see what is coming before it is obvious and make it
legible to people while it still counts." Mindmake is his mission and his one company;
Heartside, Full Time, Legibility, CTRL and Pulse roll into it. One queue: the mission
leads, and product work is ordered beneath it by the live priority ladder. Profile,
decision rules and standing rulings: `skills/krish-principles/references/who-krish-is.md`
in the harness. What he works on is live, never copied here; read it from Control Center at
https://controlcenter.krishraja.com/api/canon/KRISH.md (and `PORTFOLIO.md` beside it).

**Where the rest lives.** The operating contract, the routing contract and the
30 curated skills are in `krishanraja/ai-harness`. On a machine with the harness installed the same skills are under the user skills root, and the local copy is
authoritative for reading; the repository is authoritative for what is correct. Where none is installed (claude.ai, a cloud session), read each skill live with Control Center `get_skill`.

**This repository's own rules:** `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PACKET.md`, `docs/STATE.md`

## Administer this repository

Use `docs/HARNESS_CONTEXT.md` for the owning workflow, source of truth and checks. Preserve the goal and accepted decisions when a revision changes one part; explain material trade-offs. Verify the downstream result. Record corrections and observed outcomes through the existing capture path. Experimental results retain their conditions; inferred requirements remain proposals.
